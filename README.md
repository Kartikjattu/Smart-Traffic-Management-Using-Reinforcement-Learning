# Smart-Traffic-Management-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project introduces an intelligent traffic management system that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize signal control based on real-time traffic conditions. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent was trained to dynamically adjust traffic light phases by analyzing factors such as vehicle count, congestion level, and road events.
